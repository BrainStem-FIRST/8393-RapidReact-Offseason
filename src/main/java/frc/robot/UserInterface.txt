- We should eventually conver this into a function to map the controls within robot container and configure button bindings so that instead of checking the y button we are checking a button associated with an action. 

something like


public class driver 1{
private boolean ....
}

public controls(Driver1 driver1, Driver2 driver2) {
  driver1.somethingintake = button y
  etc. 
  etc. 
}
